Note that, interestingly, you can write a python code that
write a python code that write markdown that contains
a python code that make html.

::genhtml::
from textwrap import dedent
print(dedent("""
	::genhtml::
	from textwrap import dedent
	print(dedent('''
		::genhtml::
		print("<b> I'm bold ! </b>")
		::end-genhtml::
	'''))
	::end-genhtml::
"""))
::end-genhtml::

There is probably something to do with that.
